## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

`budget_tracker(fcc)` contains:

- A `Category` class to manage deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balances
- A `create_spend_chart()` function that generates a text-based bar chart showing the percentage spent per category
- Sample usage and test cases included directly in the notebook/code

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- Deposit and withdraw money per category
- Transfer funds between categories
- Display a well-formatted ledger using `__str__`
- Generate a vertical spend chart using only text

2. Run all cells to test the functionality and see the output
3. Modify the test cases as needed to try other categories or amounts
