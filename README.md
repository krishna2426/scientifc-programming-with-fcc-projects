# Scientific Programming with Python â€“ FreeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Each project showcases Python programming fundamentals, focusing on computation, data handling, and clean code practices.

##  Certification Overview

The **Scientific Computing with Python** certification covers:

- Python basics
- Functions and control flow
- Data structures (lists, dicts, tuples)
- String formatting
- File operations
- Testing and debugging

These concepts are applied through hands-on mini-projects.

##  Completed Projects

| No. | Project Name            | File                     | Description |
|-----|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 1.  | Arithmetic Formatter     | `arithmetic_formatter(proj_1).py` | Formats a list of arithmetic problems vertically and optionally displays the result. |
| 2.  | Time Calculator          | `time_calculator(proj_2).py`     | Adds a duration to a start time and returns the new time and day of the week. |
| 3.  | Budget App               | `budget_tracker_proj3.py`              | Simulates budgeting and creates a spending chart using . |

## ðŸ›  Upcoming Projects

These projects are part of the certification and will be added soon:

- [ ] Polygon Area Calculator
- [ ] Probability Calculator

Stay tuned for updates!
